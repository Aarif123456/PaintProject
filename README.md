# The Paint Project

This is a simple paint program like MS Paint but with a little more style. This version of the paint project is themed after the anime One Piece. 

## Quick start
    Run paint.py to get started

## Note

Bear in mind, I made this project in grade 11. So, even though I tried to refactor it, a lot of the code is still hacky and messy.
